# Leap Scholar IELTS Engagement Solution: LeapQuest

## 1. Executive Summary
**Problem:** Users suffer from fluctuating motivation and lack of clarity during long preparation cycles, leading to drop-offs. Engagement is currently reactive (mock tests) rather than proactive (habit-building).
**Objective:** Increase sessions/user and actions within 4 weeks of purchase, improving momentum and progress perception.
**Proposed Solution:** **"LeapQuest"** — A gamified, daily-habit progression system that transforms IELTS preparation into a series of achievable, bite-sized "Daily Quests" visualized on an interactive roadmap.

## 2. Core Solution: LeapQuest - The Daily Momentum Engine

### Concept
LeapQuest replaces the traditional "library of content" view with a **Visual Progression Map** (similar to Duolingo or Candy Crush). It breaks down the intimidated 4-week preparation into roughly **28 distinct milestones**, ensuring users always know their next immediate step.

### Key Features

#### A. The "Daily 3" (Micro-Habits for Busy Schedules)
*   **Mechanism:** Every day, the user is presented with exactly **3 high-impact tasks** that take less than 20 minutes total to complete.
    *   *Task 1:* **Vocabulary Blitz** (5 mins) - Learn 5 new words via flashcards.
    *   *Task 2:* **Skill Sharpener** (10 mins) - Focus on one specific weakness (e.g., "Identify False/Not Given in Reading").
    *   *Task 3:* **Speaking Sprint** (5 mins) - Record a 1-minute answer to a prompt.
*   **Why it works:** Addresses "busy schedules" and "low clarity" by removing decision paralysis. Users engage even on their busiest days because the commitment is low.

#### B. The Streak & "Freeze" Economy
*   **Mechanism:** Completing the "Daily 3" maintains a **Leap Streak**.
*   **Reward:** Higher streaks unlock exclusive "Power-Ups" (e.g., "Mock Test Detailed Analysis" or "1-on-1 Mentor Chat credits").
*   **Forgiveness:** Users earn "Streak Freezes" for every 5 days of consistency, allowing them to miss a day without losing progress (vital for early professionals with erratic work hours).
*   **Why it works:** The fear of losing a streak is a powerful motivator (loss aversion) that drives daily logins (DAU).

#### C. Weekly "Boss Battles" (Milestone Checkpoints)
*   **Mechanism:** At the end of every week (or map region), users face a **"Boss Battle"** — a 30-minute mini-mock test focusing on that week's learnings.
*   **Outcome:** Passing the battle "unlocks" the next region of the map and provides a tangible **Band Score Estimate** (e.g., "You are currently performing at Band 6.5 level").
*   **Why it works:** Provides the "visible short-term wins" identified as missing in user insights. Seeing their estimated band score rise provides immense motivation.

## 3. User Journey & Experience

### Day 1-7 (Building the Habit)
*   **Onboarding:** User sets their "Target Band" and "Daily Availability" (e.g., 30 mins).
*   **The Hook:** The first 3 days of quests are intentionally easy to build momentum.
*   **Notification Strategy:** "Your streak is at risk!" (Loss aversion) vs "Time to study" (Generic).

### Day 14-28 (Sustaining Momentum)
*   **Progression:** The map visually changes (e.g., "Bronze League" to "Silver League").
*   **Social Nudge:** "Your friend Rahul just completed his Daily Quest. Don't let him get ahead!" (Optional social leaderboard).

## 4. Impact Metrics (KPIs)

| Metric | Goal | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sessions Per User** | **+40%** | Driven by the "Daily 3" habit loop and streak maintenance. |
| **Actions Per Session** | **+25%** | Micro-tasks are easier to start and finish than full-length mocks. |
| **Retention (W4)** | **+15%** | Visual progress map reduces the feeling of being "lost" halfway through. |
| **NPS** | **Increase** | Users feel more guided and less overwhelmed. |

## 5. Potential Risks & Mitigation

*   **Risk:** Users feeling overwhelmed by a "daily" requirement.
    *   *Mitigation:* "Streak Freezes" and "Weekend Catch-up" modes allow flexibility for professionals.
*   **Risk:** Gamification feeling childish.
    *   *Mitigation:* Use a sleek, professional UI ("Premium Progress" rather than "Cartoon Game") to appeal to the 18-26 aspiring professional demographic.
